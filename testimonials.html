                        diagnostician, and has helped me root out and eliminate detrimental habits. My vocal production and delivery have
                        improved greatly; I also feel very confident approaching new music, preparing for and performing concerts, and other
                        engagements.<br><br>
                        
                        I have been a featured soloist for the Chagrin Valley Choral Union, have given solo voice recitals, and various wedding
                        and funeral engagements; Sharon has prepared me well for these.<br><br>
                        
                        The care and attention she provides during the preparation phase of any performance is extraordinary, and I wouldn’t
                        consider taking a job without having her available to get me ready. I highly recommend Sharon Shaffer, for the newest
                        beginner to the seasoned professional, she can help you give your best performance."

                        Sharon taught me proper breathing techniques, sharpened my understanding and application of music theory, and helped me
                        expand my range in octaves and genre alike. Her guidance helped me earn admittance to several highly selective colleges,
                        and I went on to sing semi-professionally in New York City. Most importantly, though, she helped build confidence in
                        myself, which carries me to this very day.<br><br>
                        
                        Sharon offers unwavering support as a teacher, a singer, and above all, as a friend. If you want to embrace your full

                        a beautiful
                        and powerful soprano voice, leading the section and as a soloist. Since 2014 Sharon has been the director
                        of the Park
                        Synagogue Shabbat choir. She has an excellent understanding of the human voice and a very good ear for coaching.
                        She has
                        been working with several of my choir singers, steadily improving their vocal production.<br><br> I would

                        Sharon’s knowledge of the Bel Canto technique is extremely thorough, and the way she is able to convey the concepts and
                        guide you through them, makes it fun and accessible to anyone- she meets you at whatever level you are at- beginner or
                        advanced, and helps work out whatever your vocal technical issues may be.<br><br>
                        
                        I have had the pleasure of taking several voice lessons with Sharon, and in my particular case, it was impressive how
                        she was able to pinpoint the technical issues I was struggling with at the time, and with the effective vocal exercises
                        she applies to the situation, we were working to further improve on agility, range and breath management through
                        appoggio. It was and continues to be very helpful!<br><br>

                        She has high expectations of her musicians and conveys her own vision of the music she’s directing. Sharon is also a
                        teacher who meets each singer where they are in their development to guide them to their full potential. I have been
                        singing professionally for 20 years and I appreciate all I’ve learned performing with her.”
